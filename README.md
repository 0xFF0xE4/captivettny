# captivettny
Auto login to ELTE NUK internal network
## Idea
A bash/python/bat/powershell/perl/other script performing auto login to teteny captive portal and some instructions how to set up autorun  
You plug in cable / start PC / wake it up from suspend, script runs automatically and voil√†, you are signed in.
## Thoughts
In linux it may be easily done with lynx browser with logging keystrokes, but there must be a better solution.
